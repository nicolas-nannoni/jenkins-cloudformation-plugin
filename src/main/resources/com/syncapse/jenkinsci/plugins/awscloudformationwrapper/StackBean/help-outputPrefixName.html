<div>
	A fixed string that will be used to prefix the outputs of the stacks. E.g. if a stack called "stackName" has two outputs "outputA" and "outputB" and this prefix set to "prefixOutput", then 4 environment variables will be created: $stackName_outputA, $stackName_outputB, $prefixOutput_outputA and $prefixOutput_outputB.
